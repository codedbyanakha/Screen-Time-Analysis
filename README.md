# Screen Time Analysis Project (Data Visualization Case Study)
This project focuses on analyzing personal mobile screen time data over a one-week period (February 9–15, 2025) to understand app usage behavior and its impact on productivity and well-being.
The analysis identifies patterns across five major applications — Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Spotify, and Phone — using Excel for data processing and Tableau for visualization.
