# Screen Time Analysis Project (Data Visualization Case Study)
This project analyzes personal mobile screen time data over a one-week period (February 9–15, 2025) to understand app usage behavior, productivity balance, and digital well-being. The analysis focuses on usage patterns across five major applications — WhatsApp, Phone, Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify — using Microsoft Power BI for interactive data visualization.
